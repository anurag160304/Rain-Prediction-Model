Rainfall Prediction Project
This project implements various machine learning models to predict rainfall based on the Australian weather dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and compare different classification algorithms for predicting whether it will rain tomorrow. The process involves data loading, comprehensive preprocessing, feature selection, training multiple models, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the results.

Dataset
The analysis is performed on the weatherAUS.csv dataset, which contains daily weather observations from numerous locations across Australia.

Methodology
The following steps were taken in this project:

Data Loading and Initial Inspection: The dataset was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and its structure and basic information were examined.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Categorical features ('RainToday', 'RainTomorrow') were converted into numerical representations.
Missing values were handled using imputation techniques: mode for categorical features and IterativeImputer for numerical features.
Outliers were identified and removed using the IQR method.
Feature Engineering and Selection:
Data was standardized using MinMaxScaler to ensure features are on a similar scale.
Relevant features were selected using both filter methods (Chi-Square) and wrapper methods (Random Forest) to improve model performance and reduce dimensionality.
Model Development and Evaluation:
The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
Several classification models were trained, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, Random Forest, LightGBM, Catboost, and XGBoost.
Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC, Cohen's Kappa, and visualized through ROC curves and confusion matrices.
Model Comparison: A detailed comparison of the models was conducted based on their performance metrics and training time to identify the most suitable model for this prediction task.
Prediction with New Data: The trained models were used to demonstrate predictions on new, simulated data.

Key Findings
The evaluation results, including accuracy, ROC AUC, and Cohen's Kappa scores, are presented and visualized in the notebook. The Neural Network, XGBoost, and CatBoost models generally showed high performance. The choice among these top-performing models might depend on specific considerations like computational resources and training speed.
